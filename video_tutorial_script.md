*Featuring Shotcaller Sam*

## INTRO: THE RUSTY TRAWLER
**[Scene: Static overlay on dark background, sounds of waves and distant radio crackling]**

**SAM:** *[Gravelly voice with FM radio static]* 

Well, well, well... *coughs* Look what we got washing up on shore today. You sickos looking for some real training, or you just here to waste my goddamn time? 

*[Takes a swig of something, ice clinking]* 

Name's Shotcaller Sam, and I'm broadcasting to you beautiful bruisers from my floating fortress of pain here off Koh Samui. Been calling fights longer than some of you've been breathing, and let me tell you something - the ring don't lie, the bag don't lie, and this app sure as hell don't lie either.

Today we're gonna tear apart this little digital trainer I helped cook up - the Nak Muay Shot Caller. Think of it as having me in your corner 24/7, minus the whiskey breath and gambling debts.

*[Radio static fades slightly]*

**SAM:** So buckle up, buttercups. Time to learn how to turn your sad shadowboxing into something that might actually keep you alive in the ring.

## PART 1: THE BASICS - "WHAT THE HELL IS THIS THING?"
**[Screen shows app homepage with style selection]**

**SAM:** Alright, listen up you beautiful disasters. This ain't your grandma's fitness app with cartoon characters and happy music. This here's the real deal - a shot caller that'll bark combinations at you like a rabid corner man while you're sweating buckets on the heavy bag.

*[Pointing at the app interface]*

See this pretty little screen? That's your gateway to pain, my friends. The Nak Muay Shot Caller works simple as a straight right - you pick your fighting style, set your rounds, and then this digital demon starts shouting techniques at you faster than a Bangkok bookie calling odds.

**SAM:** But here's the beautiful part, you knuckle-draggers - it's not just random nonsense. Each style's got its own flavor, its own personality, like different kinds of whiskey. Some smooth, some rough, all guaranteed to leave you questioning your life choices.

---

## PART 2: THE STYLES - "PICK YOUR POISON"
**[Screen shows the style grid with icons]**

**SAM:** Now we're getting to the meat and potatoes... speaking of which, that's one of our styles right there, but we'll get to that.

*[Chuckles and lights something]*

Let me break down this beautiful buffet of brutality for you:

### Timer Only
**SAM:** First up - "Timer Only." For you lazy bastards who just want a bell to tell you when to start and stop. Hey, no judgment here. Sometimes you just need the basics, like training wheels on a Harley.

### Nak Muay Newb
**SAM:** "Nak Muay Newb" - *[laughs]* - That's where all you fresh meat start. Don't get your panties in a twist about the name. We all started somewhere, and this style'll teach you the eight limbs without making your brain leak out your ears. Jabs, crosses, teeps, kicks - the building blocks that separate you from the drunk idiots throwing haymakers at the local dive bar.

### Boxing
**SAM:** "Boxing" - The sweet science, as they call it. Pure hands, like a gentleman's agreement to only use half your weapons. Classic combinations that've been dropping fools since before your great-granddaddy was born. 1-2-3, slip and rip, the fundamentals that'll serve you well when the going gets rough.

### Muay Mat, Tae, Khao, Femur, and Sok
**SAM:** Now here's where it gets spicy, you beautiful violence enthusiasts. These are the traditional Thai styles, each one deadlier than a mama-san with a bad attitude:

- **Muay Mat** - Heavy hands mixed with kicks and knees. Think of a bulldozer with boxing gloves.
- **Muay Tae** - Kickers, pure and simple. Long-range death dealers who'll take your head off from next week.
- **Muay Khao** - Clinch warriors. Get close, get dirty, and introduce your knees to their ribcage.
- **Muay Femur** - The chess masters. Technical, defensive, smarter than you'll ever be.
- **Muay Sok** - Elbow specialists. Close-range psychopaths who turn elbows into surgical instruments.

### The New Blood
**SAM:** *[Takes another drink]*

But wait, there's more! We got some new flavors for you degenerates:

- **Two-Piece Combos** - Short, sweet, and to the point. Like a telegram from hell.
- **Southpaw** - For you backwards weirdos who lead with the wrong hand. God bless your confused souls.
- **Meat & Potatoes** - Classic, high-percentage stuff. The bread and butter that wins fights.
- **Buakaw's Corner** - Aggressive clinch work inspired by the legend himself. Get ready for some knee-deep trouble.
- **Low Kick Legends** - Dutch-style devastation. Chop 'em down like trees.
- **Elbow Arsenal** - Sharp, creative, close-range chaos.
- **KO Setups** - Explosive knockout combinations for when you absolutely, positively need to ruin someone's day.

## PART 3: NUMERICAL CONVENTIONS - "THE SACRED NUMBERS"
**[Close-up on Sam's weathered hands demonstrating]**

**SAM:** Now pay attention, you knuckleheads, because this is where the magic happens. We don't have time to say "throw a left jab followed by a right cross" every damn time. That's why we got the numbers - the sacred language of the squared circle.

*[Demonstrates each punch clearly]*

- **1** - Jab. Left hand, straight out, like poking someone in the eye but legal.
- **2** - Cross. Right hand, straight across your body with some mustard on it.
- **3** - Left Hook. Comes around the side like a surprise divorce papers.
- **4** - Right Hook. Same concept, other side.
- **5** - Left Uppercut. Up from below, like hope in a dark alley.
- **6** - Right Uppercut. Ditto, but from the south.

**SAM:** Now when I bark "1-2-3," you better throw jab-cross-left hook faster than a pickpocket at tourist season. And if I call "2-3-2," that's cross-left hook-cross, smooth as aged rum.

*[Pauses, coughs]*

**SAM:** The kicks and knees and elbows? We call those by name because, frankly, there's too damn many variations to number. "Left teep," "right kick," "knee," "elbow" - keep it simple, keep it deadly.

---

## PART 4: DIFFICULTY LEVELS - "HOW MUCH PAIN CAN YOU HANDLE?"
**[Screen shows difficulty selection]**

**SAM:** Alright, tough guys and gals, time to find out how much punishment you can really handle. We got three flavors of pain here:

### Easy Mode
**SAM:** "Easy" - Don't let the name fool you, cupcakes. Easy just means I won't try to kill you on the first date. About 26 calls per minute. Perfect for you weekend warriors who think you're tough because you can open a pickle jar.

### Medium Mode
**SAM:** "Medium" - The sweet spot for most of you beautiful disasters. About 31 calls per minute. Fast enough to keep you honest, slow enough that you won't cry for your mommy... immediately.

### Hard Mode
**SAM:** "Hard" - *[Evil chuckle]* Now we're talking my language. 60 calls per minute, baby! That's one technique every second, like getting hit by a machine gun made of pain and regret. I even speed up my gravelly voice to 1.3x just to add insult to injury. This mode separates the wheat from the chaff, the men from the boys, the sane from the clinically insane.

**SAM:** Choose wisely, because once that bell rings, there's no mercy, no timeouts, and definitely no participation trophies.

---

## PART 5: CUSTOMIZATION - "MAKE IT YOUR OWN KIND OF HELL"
**[Screen shows round and timing options]**

**SAM:** Now here's where you get to play god with your own suffering, you masochistic maniacs.

### Rounds and Duration
**SAM:** You can set anywhere from 1 to 20 rounds - though if you're doing 20 rounds, you either know something I don't, or you've completely lost your damn mind. Respect either way.

Round length? Anywhere from 30 seconds for you attention-deficit types, up to 10 minutes for the absolute lunatics. Standard is 3 minutes because that's what the boxing gods decreed, and who am I to argue with tradition?

### Rest Periods
**SAM:** Rest time between rounds - because even warriors need to catch their breath and question their life decisions. Default is 1 minute, but you can crank it up if you're feeling merciful toward yourself.

### Multiple Styles
**SAM:** Here's the beautiful chaos - you can mix and match styles like a demented DJ mixing tracks. Want Boxing with a splash of Muay Sok? Go for it. Feeling like combining Nak Muay Newb with KO Setups? Why the hell not? It's your funeral.

### Calisthenics
**SAM:** And for you fitness freaks who think martial arts isn't enough torture, we got a calisthenics option. Jump squats, high knees, all that cardio nonsense mixed in with your combat training. Because apparently some of you enjoy suffering on multiple levels.

---

## PART 6: ADVANCED FEATURES - "THE SECRET WEAPONS"
**[Screen shows the advanced settings panel]**

**SAM:** Now we're getting into the really nerdy stuff, you beautiful tech-heads. The app's got more tricks than a Bangkok street magician.

### Voice Control
**SAM:** You can adjust my voice speed - though I don't know why you'd want to slow down perfection. There's different voices too, though none of them have my rugged charm and decades of whiskey-induced character.

### Read in Order vs Random
**SAM:** "Read in Order" - techniques come at you in sequence, predictable as sunrise. Good for learning, boring as watching paint dry.

Random mode? That's where the magic happens. Keeps you guessing, keeps you honest, like life in general.

### The Technique Editor
**SAM:** *[Leans in conspiratorially]*

Here's the real secret sauce, you creative psychopaths - the Technique Editor. Don't like my combinations? Think you know better? Well, step right up and prove it. You can create your own techniques, modify existing ones, build entire custom style libraries.

It's like giving a pyromaniac matches and gasoline, but for martial arts. Beautiful, dangerous, and probably a bad idea.

---

## PART 7: SECONDARY FEATURES - "THE BELLS AND WHISTLES"
**[Various screens showing logs and features]**

**SAM:** But wait, there's more! *[Coughs, laughs]*

### Workout Logs
**SAM:** The app keeps track of everything - rounds completed, techniques called, your favorite styles. It's like a diary, but instead of teenage angst, it's full of violence statistics. 

Track your streaks, see your progress, watch your pain tolerance grow like a beautiful, twisted flower.

### Wake Lock
**SAM:** Screen stays awake during training because nothing kills the mood like your phone taking a nap mid-combination. Smart little feature for us old-school types who remember when phones were just phones.

### Audio Bells
**SAM:** Real bell sounds for round starts and ends, plus a warning chime at 10 seconds left. Because nothing says "authentic training" like the sound of impending doom.

### Pre-Round Countdown
**SAM:** Five-second countdown before each round starts. Gives you time to make peace with your gods and tighten your wraps.

---

## PART 8: HOW TO ACTUALLY USE THIS THING - "THE PRACTICAL STUFF"
**[Screen showing startup sequence]**

**SAM:** Alright, enough theory. Let's talk about actually using this digital drill sergeant.

### Getting Started
**SAM:** Fire up the app, pick your poison - I mean, your fighting style. Select your difficulty level based on how much self-loathing you're feeling today. Set your rounds and duration. Hit that start button like it owes you money.

### During Training
**SAM:** Once that bell rings, you keep your eyes off the screen and your hands up. The text is there as backup, but real fighters don't need to read their combinations - they feel them in their bones.

Listen to the calls, react fast, stay loose. Think of it like the world's most violent Simon Says.

### The Rhythm
**SAM:** Find your rhythm, but don't get comfortable. The app's designed to keep you guessing, keep you sharp. Just when you think you got the pattern figured out, BAM! - curveball to the face.

## PART 9: PRO TIPS FROM THE OLD SALT
**[Close-up on Sam, serious tone]**

**SAM:** *[Puts down drink, leans forward]*

Now listen up, because this is the good stuff - the wisdom that comes from decades of watching fighters rise and fall like tides.

### Tip #1: Start Slow
**SAM:** Don't be a hero on day one. Start with Easy mode, even if your ego's screaming. Better to build good habits slowly than to develop terrible form quickly. The app'll be here tomorrow, and so will your pride.

### Tip #2: Focus on Form
**SAM:** Speed without technique is just flailing around like a drunken octopus. Master the movements first, then worry about keeping up with my beautiful voice.

### Tip #3: Mix It Up
**SAM:** Don't get stuck in one style forever. Cross-train like your life depends on it, because in the ring, it just might. A Muay Tae fighter who can't box is like a one-legged cat in a sandbox - functional, but limited.

### Tip #4: Listen to Your Body
**SAM:** Pain is temporary, but stupid is forever. If something hurts wrong, back off. The app's not going anywhere, but your joints are irreplaceable.

### Tip #5: Make It Ritual
**SAM:** Consistency beats intensity every damn time. Better to train 15 minutes daily than 3 hours once a week. Turn it into ritual, like morning coffee or evening regret.

## PART 10: TROUBLESHOOTING - "WHEN SHIT GOES WRONG"
**[Screen showing various settings]**

**SAM:** Because nothing in life works perfectly, especially technology...

### Audio Issues
**SAM:** If you can't hear my dulcet tones, check your volume, check your permissions. Sometimes phones are as stubborn as mules and twice as stupid.

### Voice Speed Problems
**SAM:** If I'm talking too fast or too slow, adjust the speed in settings. Though personally, I think I'm perfect at any speed.

### App Crashes
**SAM:** If the app dies on you, just restart it. Like an old motorcycle, sometimes it needs a kick to get going.

### Technique Confusion
**SAM:** Don't know what a "question mark kick" is? That's what the glossary is for. Or better yet, find a real coach and learn proper form. This app assumes you know the basics - it's not a substitute for actual training.

---

## PART 11: THE PHILOSOPHY - "WHY WE DO THIS MADNESS"
**[Sam looks directly at camera, ocean sounds in background]**

**SAM:** *[More reflective tone, still gravelly]*

You know, sitting here on my floating rust bucket, watching the sun set over the Gulf of Thailand, I sometimes wonder why we put ourselves through this beautiful torture.

*[Pause, distant bell buoy]*

**SAM:** But then I remember - it's not about the pain, it's about what's on the other side of the pain. It's about discipline when discipline is hard. It's about showing up when showing up sucks. It's about becoming the kind of person who doesn't quit when things get ugly.

This app, this training, this whole beautiful mess - it's not really about learning to fight. It's about learning to fight through. Through fear, through fatigue, through that voice in your head that says "quit."

**SAM:** Every combination you throw, every round you complete, every time you restart after stopping - that's you building character, one technique at a time. And character, my friends, is what separates the fighters from the quitters, the warriors from the wannabes.

---

## PART 12: THE COMMUNITY - "YOU'RE NOT ALONE"
**[Screen shows workout logs and stats]**

**SAM:** Now here's something beautiful - you're part of something bigger now. Every person using this app, sweating to my voice, pushing through when it gets tough - that's a brotherhood, a sisterhood, a tribe of beautiful misfits who chose the hard path.

**SAM:** Check your workout logs, see your progress, but remember - the numbers don't tell the whole story. The real victory is in showing up, day after day, even when you don't feel like it.

*[Takes a contemplative sip]*

**SAM:** And hey, if you ever make it down to Thailand, look for the rusty trawler off Koh Samui. I'll probably be here, calling combinations to the fish and practicing my philosophy on anyone drunk enough to listen.

---

## OUTRO: THE FINAL BELL
**[Static returns, waves get louder]**

**SAM:** Well, that's all the wisdom this old salt's got for today, you beautiful disasters. You've got the tools, you've got the knowledge, and if you've been paying attention, you've got a little piece of my twisted soul in there too.

*[Bell rings in distance]*

**SAM:** Remember - the app's just the messenger. The real work happens when you step up to that bag, when you throw those combinations, when you push through when every fiber of your being is screaming to quit.

*[Radio static increases]*

**SAM:** This is Shotcaller Sam, broadcasting from somewhere between sanity and the deep blue sea, reminding you that champions aren't born - they're forged in sweat, shaped by pain, and tempered by persistence.

Now get out there and hit something. Legally.

*[Static fades to black]*

**SAM:** *[Fading voice]* 

And remember, you sick, beautiful, masochistic warriors - pain is temporary, but glory... glory is forever.

*[Ocean waves, distant bell, fade out]*
