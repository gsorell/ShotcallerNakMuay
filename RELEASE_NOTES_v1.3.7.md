# Release Notes v1.3.7 (Build 41)

**Release Date:** October 29, 2025

## 🔥 Enhanced Pro Difficulty

### Major Improvements
- **Increased Work Rate by ~15-20%**: Pro difficulty is now significantly more challenging
- **Faster Callout Frequency**: Increased from 37 to 42 calls per minute (+13.5%)
- **Quicker Voice Speed**: Increased from 1.3x to 1.4x speed (+7.7%)
- **More Aggressive Timing**: Tighter buffers, caps, and delays for relentless pacing

### Technical Enhancements
- **Reduced Buffer Time**: 15% → 12% (tighter timing between callouts)
- **Stricter Timing Caps**: 90% → 85% (more aggressive maximum delays)
- **Faster Fallback Timing**: 70% → 65% (even faster when TTS isn't available)
- **More Aggressive Minimum Delays**: 40% → 35% (allows shorter gaps)
- **Reduced Jitter**: ±6% → ±5% (more consistent, relentless pace)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Shots Counter**: Counter now properly resets to 0 at the start of each workout session
- **Resolved Inconsistent Counts**: Previously, the shots counter would accumulate across multiple sessions, leading to inflated numbers

## 📊 Impact
Pro difficulty users can expect:
- **5 more technique callouts per minute**
- **7.7% faster speech delivery**
- **Significantly tighter gaps** between callouts
- **More consistent pressure** with less timing variation
- **Overall more demanding pace** that tests reaction time and conditioning

## 🎯 For Advanced Practitioners
This update makes Pro difficulty truly challenging for experienced fighters who want to push their limits while maintaining the responsive timing system that adapts to actual speech duration.
